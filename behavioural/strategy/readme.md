- Many algorithms can be converted into high and low-level parts
- Making tea can be decomposed into
    - The process of making hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup) - High level
    - Tea specific things (put teabag into water) - Low Level
- The high level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate
    - Supported by beverage specific strategy


**Strategy enables the exact behaviour of a system to be selected at run time**

- Define an algorithm at a high level
- Define an interface you expect the Strategy to follow
- Provide for dynamic compositions of strategies in the resulting object
