1. Want to augment an object with additional functionality
2. Do and want to rewrite or alter existing code
3. Want to keep new functionality separate
4. Need to be able to interact with existing structures
5. Two options
    - Inherit from required object
    - Build a decorated which references the decorated objects

**Facilitates the addition of behaviours to individual objects without inheriting them**
