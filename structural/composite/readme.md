1. Objects use other objects through inheritance and composition
2. Composition lets us make compound objects
    - A grouping of shapes that consist of several other shapes
3. Composite design pattern is used to scale both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
    - ie `Foo and Sequence` have common properties like `yielding Foos`
