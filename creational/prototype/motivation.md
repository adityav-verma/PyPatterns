1. Complicated objects like (cars) are not designed from scratch
   - They reiterate existing designs
2. A existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a `Prototype`
3. We make copy of the object and customise it
    - Requires `Deep Copy` support
4. We make cloning convenient by abstracting it out in a `Factory`


**A Prototype is a partially or fully constructed object, that you clone and make use of.**
